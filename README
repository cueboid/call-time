jeffy & johnny call timer

this (bad) program literally just shows the amount of time since the unix timestamp "1710524911".
1710524911 is when a voice call in the jeffy & johnny groupchat on discord started.
as of april 1st 00:00 UTC, the call is currently ongoing and is at 9150 hours.
this program dosen't actually check if the call is still ongoing, so i'll update the README if it ends.

(
    this program is really intended just for my own use,
    but it's not like im just gonna make the repository private without reason.
    i also like the idea of making a program that people can download and use.
    it's practace for making things people could find useful in the future, at least.
