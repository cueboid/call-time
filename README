jeffy & johnny call timer

this (bad) program literally just shows the amount of time since the unix timestamp "1744316124".
this time is when a voice call in the jeffy & johnny groupchat on discord started.
as of may 19th 9:51 UTC, the call is ongoing and is currently at 38 days, 13 hours.
this program dosen't actually check if the call is still ongoing, so i'll update the README if it ends.

our previous call lasted over 1 year, and we almost hit 10,000 hours. however, it ended on thursday, april 10th, 2025 :(

(
    this program is really intended just for my own use,
    but it's not like im just gonna make the repository private without reason.
    i also like the idea of making a program that people can download and use.
    it's practace for making things people could find useful in the future, at least.
